# Practical Project Specification

# **Lottery**

## **Objective:**

#### My overall objective for this project is to create four services that connect through docker swarm and will be deployed via Jenkins. I decided to create a account number and prize generator. This entails that I will have

## **Requirements:**

#### **The requirements for this project are as follows:**

#### * Kanban board via Trello.
#### * Risks and issue report detailed documentation via Kanban board and README.md.
#### *An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
#### * Webhooks as I will be showing changes to my code and branch. Webhooks will be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application.
#### * Use of Service-orientated architecture. I will create four serivces one branch and changes made to the services on another branch.
#### * I will use Docker, which is a containasisation tool and Docker Swarn a a orchastration tool.
#### * I will use Nginx to create a reverse proxy to ensure one pathway to my application is created.
#### * I will create an Ansible Playbook that will supply the environment that my application needs in order to run.
